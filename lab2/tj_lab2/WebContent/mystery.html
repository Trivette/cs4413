<h2>Myster page explained</h2>
<p>My myster page was the betting page.  It will show a list of active games and allow the user to input a game id and bet amount.
<br>If the user selects a game id that is not in the list of games, it will error.
<br>If the user does not bet between 1 and 10, it will error.
<br>The bet page will log the time the bet was made and, in the future, disallow bets that are on games that have started more than 5 minutes ago.
<br>
<br>A lot of these checks are on variables that will be implemented at a later time with the database.  Thus, validation right now on game id is just to make sure it is not empty.
<br>Time requires no validation because it is provided by the system.

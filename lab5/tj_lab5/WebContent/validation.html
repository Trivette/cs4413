<h3>Bet Class</h3>
Bet Amount is validated and must be between 1 and 10<br>
Game is validated and must not be empty.  Right now it doesn't check to see if the game id supplied is valid, but it will in the future.  I could use fake data, but that is a waste.<br>
Time is validated and must not be empty.  In the future it will check current time against game time and disallow bets that are 5 minutes after game has started.  Time is not validated because it is set when the object is created.<br>
